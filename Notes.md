# Python

## Intro

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability and syntax that allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code compared to other languages like C++ or Java.

### Key Features of Python:

1. **Simple and Easy to Learn**: Python's syntax is designed to be intuitive and its language constructs make it easy to learn, even for beginners.
2. **Versatile**: Python is a general-purpose language used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, automation, and more.
3. **Interpreted Language**: Python code is executed line-by-line, which makes debugging easier but can impact performance.
4. **Extensive Standard Library**: Python comes with a large standard library that includes modules and packages for virtually every task, from file I/O to web development.
5. **Cross-Platform**: Python is available on multiple operating systems including Windows, macOS, and Linux, which allows for cross-platform development.
6. **Community Support**: Python has a large and active community, contributing to a wealth of third-party modules and tools, as well as extensive documentation and tutorials.

### Common Use Cases:

- **Web Development**: Frameworks like Django and Flask make Python a popular choice for backend web development.

   - **Use Cases**: Embedded systems, Internet of Things (IoT) projects, and other resource-constrained environments.

### Python Language Specification

The Python language specification is outlined in the Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs), which are documents that describe new features, processes, and information about the Python language. Key PEPs include:

1. **PEP 8**:

   - **Title**: Style Guide for Python Code
   - **Content**: Provides conventions for writing readable and maintainable Python code, including naming conventions, indentation, and more.

2. **PEP 20**:

   - **Title**: The Zen of Python
   - **Content**: A collection of aphorisms that capture the philosophy of Python, emphasizing simplicity, readability, and the importance of writing explicit code.

3. **PEP 484**:

   - **Title**: Type Hints
   - **Content**: Introduces optional type hinting to Python, enabling static type checking and better code clarity without changing the runtime behavior.

4. **PEP 257**:
   - **Title**: Docstring Conventions
   - **Content**: Guidelines for writing docstrings in Python, including conventions for formatting and content.

### Conclusion

The various implementations of Python cater to different needs, whether it's performance optimization with PyPy, integration with Java via Jython, or embedded systems development with MicroPython. The language specification, primarily driven by PEPs, ensures that Python maintains consistency, readability, and a coherent philosophy across its implementations.

## Variables

Defining variables in python is very easy

```py
name = "Mostafa"
age = 23
height = 175.5
married = False

```

assigning the same value to multiple variables

```py
a = b = c = 19
```

assigning multiple variable in the same line

```py
a, b = 1, 5
```

### Type Annotation

Python is a **dynamic-typed language** which means variable types are determined at **run time** unlike **static-typed languages** which types are determined at **compile time**.

in python changing variable's value to completely different types

```py

name = "Mostafa"
# then somewhere in the program you change value of name to something completely different
name = 100

```

from **python 3.6** we can annotate variable types

```py
name: str = "Mostafa"
age: int = 23
```

### Mutable and Immutable Types

`id()` is a global function which returns the memory location allocated for the specified identifier

```py

x = 1

print(id(x))# => 1384214063408

x = x + 1


print(id(x))# => 1384214063440

nums = [1,2,4]
print(id(nums)) # => 2331135203072

nums.append(10)
print(id(nums)) # => 2331135203072

```

## Strings

Strings are immutable data-types

`len()` is a global function which returns the number of character of a string or number of elements in a list

```py
course = "Python Programming"
print(len(course)) # 18 => number of characters in the string
print(course[0]) # p => first character of string
print(course[-1]) # g => first element form the end of the string
print(course[0:3]) # pyt => a slice of string starting from 0 (first element) to 3 (fourth element but except itself)
print(course[:]) # Python Programming => from first to last element or the whole string
print(course[:2]) # Pyt =>starting point omitted 0 used as default value
print(course[4:]) # on Programming => ending point omitted len(course) used as default value

# strings are immutable therefore new memory is located for each string operation
print(id(course)) # 1345471682240
print(id(course[0])) # 1345471658224
```

### Scape Sequences

`\'`
`\"`
`\n`
`\t`
`\\`

### Formatted Strings

formatted string unlike string literal isn't a value instead is an expression which will evaluate at run-time

`F""`, `f""`, `f''` and `F''` are all the same and represent a formatted-string

`{}` are used within formatted-strings to include a dynamic value or in general we can put any valid expression within `{}`

```py

first = "Mostafa"
last = "Meerzad"
full = first + " " + last # string concatenation

full = f"{first} {last}" # formatted string
full = F"{first} {last}" # formatted string

print(full)
print(f"this is the length of fullName {len(full)}")
```

### String Methods

```py
course = " Python Programming on"

print(course.upper()) # returns a copy of the string turned into uppercase
print(course.lower()) # returns a copy of the string turned into lowercase
print(course.split(" "))  # returns a list of parts of the string separated with the provided separator
print(course.strip()) # returns a copy of string with leading and trailing whitespaces removed
print(course.rstrip()) # stript right
print(course.lstrip()) # strip left
print(course.count("on", 0, 9)) # Return the number of non-overlapping occurrences of substring sub in string
print(course.count("m"))
print(course.casefold()) # removes casing, useful for comparison
print(course.istitle()) # True if string is titleCase
print(course.islower())
print(course.isupper())
print(course.isalnum()) # True if string is alphanumeric (mix of letters and numbers)

print(course.find("Pro")) # returns the starting index of substring -1 if non existing
print(course.replace(" ", "#")) # reruns a copy of string with characters replaced

print("Programming" in course) # use in operator to check if substring is included in the string
print("Python" not in course) # not operator also exist to negate

```

## Numbers

```py
num = 10

x = 0b10  # 0b followed by a binary number, representation of literal binary numbers
print(x)
# bin(num) function return the binary representation of given number
print(bin(x))
print(bin(2))

y = 0x12c  # 0x followed by a hexadecimal number, representation of literal hexadecimal numbers
print(y)
# hex(num) function return the hexadecimal representation of given number
print(hex(y))
print(y)

# a + bi
z = 1 + 2j
print(z)

```

### Arithmetic Operations

```py
a = 1 + 2
a = 1 - 2
a = 1 * 2
a = 1 / 2 # floating-point division
a = 1 // 2 #
a = 1 % 2 # remainder or modulus
a = 1 ** 2 # exponentiation

a += 1
a -= 1
a *= 1
a /= 1.5
a //= 1
a %= 1
a **= 1

# all above are the same pattern as following

a = a + 1
a = a * 1
a = a // 1
```

**Note**: in python unlike other programming languages we don't have _increment_ or _decrement_ operators like `x++` or `x--`

### Working with Numbers

```py
import math

x = 3.49
print(math.floor(x))
print(math.ceil(x))
print(round(x))
print(abs(x))
print(math.pi)
```

## Type Conversion

Python is a strongly-typed language which means it doesn't perform type conversions on it's own and type conversion is our responsibility, unlike languages like javascript that is loosely-typed language which performs type-conversion without explicitly saying to.

Sometimes we need to convert types from one to another, here are functions used for type-conversion

`str(val)` converts val to string, `int(val)` converts val to integer, `bool(val)` coverts val to boolean, `float(val)` converts val to floating-point,

**Falsy values**:
**False**, **""**, **[]**, **0** and **None**

**any value that is not falsy is truthy**

## Conditional Statements

In python we don't have parenthesis or curly-braces for conditional statements just **indentation**

```py
age = 24

if age >= 18:
    print("Adult")
elif age >= 13:
    print("Teenager")
else:
    print("Child")

print("All done!")

```

if you need to have an empty block use **pass** keyword

```py
if x > 1:
   pass
else:
   pass
```

## Logical Operators

`and`, `or` and `not` are logical operators

```py

# name = "John"
name = ""

# name = " "  # " " a string with just one space is not considered an empty string
# if not name.strip(): # solution is to strip the white-spaces

if not name.strip():
    print("name is empty")

age = 19

if age >= 18 and age < 65:
    print("Eligible")

# the same comparison as above
if 18 <= age < 65: # this is called chaining comparison-operators
    print("Eligible")

```

## Ternary Operator

```py
age = 22

if age >= 18:
    message = "Eligible"
else:
    message = "Not Eligible"
print(message)
```

same statement with ternary-operator in python way

```py

age = 22
message = "Eligible" if age >= 18 else "Not Eligible"
print(message)

```
