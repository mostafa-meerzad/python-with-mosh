# Managing Packages with pip

In Python, package management involves using tools to install, update, and manage libraries and dependencies. Here’s a
comprehensive guide:

---

### **1. Using `pip` (Python's Package Installer)**

`pip` is the default package manager for Python. You can use it to install, upgrade, and uninstall packages.

#### **Install a package**

```bash
pip install package_name
```

Example:

```bash
pip install requests
```

#### **Upgrade a package**

```bash
pip install --upgrade package_name
```

#### **Uninstall a package**

```bash
pip uninstall package_name
```

#### **List installed packages**

```bash
pip list
```

#### **Save dependencies to a file**

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

#### **Install dependencies from a file**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### **2. Virtual Environments**

A virtual environment creates an isolated Python environment for a project, ensuring dependencies don’t conflict with
other projects.

#### **Create a virtual environment**

```bash
python -m venv venv_name
```

#### **Activate the virtual environment**

- **Windows:**
  ```bash
  venv_name\Scripts\activate
  ```
- **macOS/Linux:**
  ```bash
  source venv_name/bin/activate
  ```

#### **Deactivate the virtual environment**

```bash
deactivate
```

---

### **3. Using `conda` (if using Anaconda/Miniconda)**

`conda` is another popular package manager that works well with data science and machine learning workflows.

#### **Create an environment**

```bash
conda create --name env_name
```

#### **Activate the environment**

```bash
conda activate env_name
```

#### **Install a package**

```bash
conda install package_name
```

#### **List environments**

```bash
conda env list
```

---

### **4. Dependency Management Tools**

These tools simplify managing dependencies in larger projects:

#### **Poetry**

A modern tool for dependency management and packaging.

- Install Poetry:
  ```bash
  pip install poetry
  ```
- Add a dependency:
  ```bash
  poetry add package_name
  ```
- Install all dependencies:
  ```bash
  poetry install
  ```

#### **Pipenv**

Combines `pip` and virtual environments.

- Install Pipenv:
  ```bash
  pip install pipenv
  ```
- Install a package:
  ```bash
  pipenv install package_name
  ```

---

### **Best Practices**

1. **Always use virtual environments** to isolate project dependencies.
2. **Pin dependencies** in a `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` file for consistent environments.
3. **Update regularly** but carefully—test your code after upgrading dependencies.
4. Use tools like `pip-tools` or `poetry` for better dependency resolution.

To install a specific version of a package in Python using `pip`, you can specify the desired version with the `==`
syntax. Here's how to manage **major**, **minor**, and **patch** versions:

---

### **1. Install a Specific Version**

```bash
pip install package_name==x.y.z
```

- `x`: Major version.
- `y`: Minor version.
- `z`: Patch version.

#### Example:

To install version `2.25.1` of the `requests` package:

```bash
pip install requests==2.25.1
```

---

### **2. Install a Range of Versions**

You can specify version constraints with the following operators:

- `>=` (greater than or equal to)
- `<=` (less than or equal to)
- `<` (less than)
- `>` (greater than)
- `~=` (compatible release)

#### Examples:

- Install any `2.x.x` version (compatible with 2.0.0 but not 3.0.0):
  ```bash
  pip install requests~=2.0
  ```
- Install any version between `2.25.0` and `2.25.5` (inclusive):
  ```bash
  pip install requests>=2.25.0,<=2.25.5
  ```

---

### **3. Specify Versions in `requirements.txt`**

If you're managing a project, you can specify versions in a `requirements.txt` file.

#### Example `requirements.txt`:

```text
requests==2.25.1  # Exact version
flask>=2.0.0      # Minimum version
numpy<2.0         # Less than a specific version
```

Install from this file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### **4. Check Available Versions**

Before installing, you may want to see all available versions of a package.

#### Command:

```bash
pip index versions package_name
```

#### Example:

```bash
pip index versions requests
```

---

## **Virtual Environments**

### **What Are Virtual Environments?**

A virtual environment is a self-contained directory that contains a Python interpreter and libraries specific to a
project. This isolation prevents conflicts between dependencies of different projects.

### **Why Use Virtual Environments?**

1. **Avoid Dependency Conflicts**: Different projects may require different versions of the same library.
2. **Reproducibility**: Ensures that the development environment is consistent across systems.
3. **Clean Global Environment**: Keeps your system-wide Python installation free of unnecessary or conflicting packages.

### **How to Work With Virtual Environments?**

#### **Creating a Virtual Environment**

Use the built-in `venv` module:

```bash
python -m venv myenv
```

#### **Activating the Environment**

- **Windows**:
  ```bash
  myenv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- **macOS/Linux**:
  ```bash
  source myenv/bin/activate
  ```

#### **Deactivating the Environment**

```bash
deactivate
```

#### **Deleting a Virtual Environment**

Simply delete the `myenv` directory:

```bash
rm -rf myenv
```

## **Tools for Dependency Management**

### **1. `pipenv`**

`pipenv` integrates `pip` and virtual environments, providing a streamlined workflow for dependency management.

#### **Key Features**

- Combines virtual environment creation and package management.
- Generates `Pipfile` (for dependencies) and `Pipfile.lock` (for pinned versions).
- Automatically resolves dependency conflicts.

#### **Installation**

```bash
pip install pipenv
```

### Then add `pipenv` to the User Variables

### **1. Verify `pipenv` Installation**

First, confirm where `pipenv` is installed:

```cmd
pip show pipenv
```

Look for the `Location` field in the output. It should point to a directory like:

```
c:\users\mostafa\appdata\roaming\python\python312\site-packages
```

Next, check the **Scripts** directory:

```
c:\users\mostafa\appdata\roaming\python\python312\scripts
```

The `pipenv` executable should be in this directory.

---

### **2. Add `pipenv` to the PATH**

You need to add the directory containing `pipenv` to your system’s PATH.

#### **Steps to Add to PATH on Windows:**

1. Press **Win + R**, type `sysdm.cpl`, and press **Enter**.
2. Go to the **Advanced** tab and click **Environment Variables**.
3. Under **User variables**, find the `Path` variable and click **Edit**.
4. Click **New** and add the path to the `Scripts` directory:
   ```
   c:\users\mostafa\appdata\roaming\python\python312\scripts
   ```
5. Click **OK** to close all windows.

#### **Verify PATH Update**

Restart your terminal or open a new CMD session. Then, check if `pipenv` is recognized:

```cmd
pipenv --version
```

---

### **3. Use Full Path (Temporary Workaround)**

If you don’t want to modify the PATH, you can run `pipenv` directly using its full path:

```cmd
c:\users\mostafa\appdata\roaming\python\python312\scripts\pipenv install requests
```

---

### **4. Install `pipenv` for All Users (Alternative)**

If you prefer not to deal with PATH issues for the current user, install `pipenv` for all users:

```cmd
pip install --user pipenv
```

Then retry running:

```cmd
pipenv install requests
```


#### **Usage**

- **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**:
  ```bash
  pipenv shell
  ```
- **Install a Package**:
  ```bash
  pipenv install package_name
  ```
- **Install Development Dependencies**:
  ```bash
  pipenv install package_name --dev
  ```
- **Generate a `requirements.txt` File**:
  ```bash
  pipenv lock -r > requirements.txt
  ```
- **Install from `Pipfile`**:
  ```bash
  pipenv install
  ```

#### **Why Use `pipenv`?**

1. Combines the functionality of `virtualenv` and `pip`.
2. Better dependency conflict resolution.
3. Lock files ensure deterministic builds.

### **2. Poetry**

`Poetry` is a modern tool for dependency and project management.

#### **Key Features**

- Manages dependencies, virtual environments, and packaging in one tool.
- Supports `pyproject.toml`, aligning with Python's PEP 517 and PEP 518 standards.
- Simplifies publishing Python packages.

#### **Installation**

```bash
pip install poetry
```

#### **Usage**

- **Create a New Project**:
  ```bash
  poetry new myproject
  ```
- **Add Dependencies**:
  ```bash
  poetry add package_name
  ```
- **Install All Dependencies**:
  ```bash
  poetry install
  ```
- **Run in Virtual Environment**:
  ```bash
  poetry shell
  ```

---

### **3. `virtualenv`**

`virtualenv` is an older but still widely used tool for creating virtual environments.

#### **Installation**

```bash
pip install virtualenv
```

#### **Usage**

- **Create a Virtual Environment**:
  ```bash
  virtualenv myenv
  ```
- **Activate and Deactivate**:
  Same as `venv`.

### **Best Practices**

1. Use **`pipenv`** or **Poetry** for most projects, especially those with complex dependencies.
2. For simple needs, **`venv`** is lightweight and sufficient.
3. Avoid global installations of libraries unless absolutely necessary.
